\begin{abstract}
Crowdsourcing has proved crucial to the extraction and collection of information about real-world entities from specialized data verticals. Existing crowdsourced data extraction solutions use non-adaptive querying strategies that repeatedly ask workers to provide information about entities from a fixed domain until a desired level of coverage is reached. Due to the cost of human labor, such solutions can be highly impractical as they yield many duplicate extractions and do not optimize for the total cost involved. In this paper, we design adaptive querying strategies that maximize the number of distinct extracted entities for a given budget. We show that the problem of budgeted crowdsourced entity extraction is NP-Hard. We leverage two insights that allow us to prune futile queries: {\em exploiting the structure of the domain of interest}, and {\em using exclude lists to limit repeated extractions}.  We develop new statistical tools to reason about the number of new distinct extracted entities of {\em further queries} under the presence of little information. We introduce algorithms to discover adaptive querying strategies that maximize the distinct extracted entities under budget constraints. We evaluate our techniques on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating an improvement of up to 300\% over competing approaches for the same budget.
