\begin{abstract}
Structured data repositories, such as knowledge bases, ontologies, or taxonomies, have
dramatically increased our ability to identify and interpret information.
While successful in improving or enriching keyword search, question answering, 
event detection, and recommender systems, structured data repositories
suffer from a lack of fine-grained data in the {\em long tail.}
% Our ability to extract, collect and organize information has increased drastically due to the presence of knowledge bases, taxonomies and other data repositories. While successful in improving search results and enriching question answering, event monitoring or recommendation systems, repositories of organized data suffer from a lack of fine-grained data in the {\em long tail}. 
Crowdsourcing, on the other hand, has been proven effective in extracting fine-grained information. However, current approaches for using the crowd to extract and collect data (e.g., list all events (concerts, rallies, etc.) in Greece) focus on asking the 
\agp{Quibble: you shouldn't use parens within parens. Also, I don't like this example because it talks of a temporal phenomenon, without alluding to it directly--I don't also know what time you're talking about in the query. I think it's fine to 
motivate with a concrete case where we would like to enrich our knowledge base with non-temporal facts.}
same query (e.g., ``list an event in Greece'') repeatedly. As a result, they are wasteful, since a small number of popular entities are provided by many workers, leading to increased duplicates, with the less popular entities not being as prevalent in the set of extracted entities.  

In this paper, we develop CRUX, a CRowdsoUrced data eXtraction framework that significantly limits duplicate extractions (and thereby wasted cost) by leveraging attributes that characterize these entities. For instance, we can instead ask queries such as ``list a rock-concert in Greece'', or ``list a demonstration in Greece'', that allows us to explore a larger space of entities by asking targeted queries. However, the ability to ask richer queries comes with a host of issues, especially since many queries may return empty answers.  We develop new statistical tools to reason about the gain, i.e., the number of new distinct extracted entities, of issuing {\em further queries} under the presence of little to no information allowing us to effectively prune futile queries. We also develop algorithms to discover adaptive querying strategies that seek to maximize the number of distinct extracted entities under budget constraints. We evaluate our techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating a yield of up to 4X over competing approaches for the same budget.
