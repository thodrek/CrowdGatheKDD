\section{Discovering Querying Policies}
\label{sec:solving}
We now turn our attention to the core component of CRUX and introduce a heuristic multi-round adaptive optimization algorithm for identifying querying strategies that maximize the total gain across all rounds under the given budget constraints. At each round we assume oracle access to a gain estimator for any generalized query $q^v(k,E)$. Such oracles can be constructed using the techniques introduced in the previous section. The gain of each query can be viewed as a random variable. By issuing a query we get to observe the value of this random variable and using the previous observations we need to decide which query to issue. Given the above, our framework builds upon ideas from the multi-armed bandit literature~\cite{Auer:2003,EvenDar06actionelimination}. Before presenting our framework we discuss some challenges associated with this adaptive optimization problem.

\squishlist
\item The first challenge is that the number of nodes in $\hierarchy$ is exponential in the number of attributes $\attributes$ describing the domain of interest. Querying every possible node to estimate its expected return for different queries $q^v(k,E)$ is prohibitively expensive. That said, typical budgets do not allow algorithms to query all nodes in the hierarchy, so this intractability may not hurt us all that much. For example, we keep estimates for each of the nodes for which at least one entity has been retrieved.
\item The second challenge is balancing the tradeoff between {\em exploitation} and {\em exploration}~\cite{Auer:2003}. The first refers to querying nodes for which sufficient entities have been retrieved, and hence, we have an accurate estimate for their expected gain; the latter refers to exploring nodes to avoid myopic policies.
\item The last challenge is optimizing over the exclude list to be used in queries. Optimizing over all potential exclude lists (i.e., considering all potential subsets of observed entities to be added in the list) leads to an exponential explosion of the query space. As we discuss next, optimizing over all potential query configurations $(k,l,v)$ can limit the query space significantly.

\subsection{Optimizing over Query Configurations}
\label{sec:config}
Instead of optimizing over all potential queries $q^v(k,E)$, we optimize over all potential query configurations $(k,l,v)$. That is, we do not optimize directly for the exclude list to be used in a further query but rather for the size $l$ of it. Once we decide on $l$ the exclude list $E$ can be constructed following a randomized approach, where $l$ of the retrieved entities are included in the list uniformly at random. We follow a randomized approach since a deterministic construction of $E$ that picks the {\em l-most} popular items in the running sample is very sensitive to the {\em observed popularity distribution}. When the number of observed entities corresponds to a small portion of the entire population -- as in the scenarios we consider in this paper -- the individual entity popularity estimates tend to be noisy.  We empirically observed that a deterministic construction of a limited size exclude list, especially during early queries, leads to poor popularity estimates. Thus, we follow a randomized approach. Below we denote a query configuration $(k,l,v)$ and a query $q^v(k,E)$ with $|E| = l$ using the same symbol $q$ for convenience. Given $l$ we construct $E$ following the aforementioned approach.

Given the above, we need to estimate the gain for a query configuration $(k,l,v)$ instead of a query $q^v(k,E)$. When $l = 0$, i.e., $E = \emptyset$, then we can directly use the techniques introduced in \Cref{sec:gainestimators}. When $l \neq 0$, we use the following approach. We generate multiple instances of $q^v(k,E)$ queries following the configuration $(k,l,v)$ and use the techniques from \Cref{sec:gainestimators} to estimate the expected gain of ite. The exclude list of each query is generated following the randomized approach described above. Finally, we estimate the expected gain of configuration $(k,l,v)$ by considering the average gain of all generated query instances. The variance of the gain is also considered for determining an upper bound on the gain of the query configuration $(k,l,v)$ as described next.

\subsection{Balancing Exploration and Exploitation}
\label{sec:balancing}
In the previous subsection we described how we can estimate the expected gain of a query configuration $(k,l,v)$. However, this estimate is based on a rather small sample of the underlying population. Thus, exploiting this information at every round may lead to suboptimal decisions. Because of this we need to balance the trade-off between exploiting query configurations for which the estimated gain is high and configurations that have not been selected many times. Formally, the latter corresponds to upper-bounding the expected gain of each query configuration with a {\em confidence interval} that depends on both the variance of the expected gain and the number of times a query has been issued~\cite{Auer:2003}.

Next we will use $q$ to denote a query configuration $(k,l,v)$. Let $r(q)$ denote the expected gain of $q$. This is an estimate of the true gain $r^*(q)$. Moreover, let $\sigma(q)$ be an error component on the gain of configuration $q$ chosen such that $r(q) - \sigma(q) \leq r^*(q) \leq r(q) + \sigma(q)$ with high probability. The parameter $\sigma(q)$ should take into account both the {\bf empirical variance} of the expected gain as well as our {\bf uncertainty} about the gain of query configuration $q$ if $q$ has been chosen only a few times. Given the quantities $r(q)$ and $\sigma(q)$, we assign a score to each configuration by considering a linear function of the quantity $r(q) + \sigma(q)$. This score prioritizes exploration when the variance or our uncertainty is high, and thus, we could potentially discover a profitable new configuration, and exploitation when the estimated gain is high. Next, we discuss how we set the quantity $\sigma(q)$.

We proceed in rounds and at each round select a query configuration $q$. Let $n_{q,t}$ be the number of times we have chosen $q$ by round $t$, and let $v_{q,t}$ denote the maximum value between some constant (e.g., $0.01$) and the empirical variance for the gain for $q$ at round $t$. The latter can be computed using bootstrapping over the retrieved sample and applying the estimators presented in \Cref{sec:gainestimators} over these bootstrapped samples. Several techniques have been proposed in the multi-armed bandits literature to compute the parameter $\sigma(q)$~\cite{teytaud:inria-00173263}. Teytaud et al.~\cite{teytaud:inria-00173263} showed that techniques considering both the variance and the number of times an action, here a query, has been chosen tend to outperform other proposed methods. Based on this observation, we choose to use the following formula for sigma:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:upper}
\sigma(q,t) = \sqrt{\frac{v_{q,t}\cdot\log(t)}{n_{q,t}}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{A Multi-Round Querying Policy Algorithm}
\label{sec:heuristic}
We now introduce a multi-round algorithm for solving the budgeted entity enumeration problem. An overview of our multi-round optimization algorithm is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algo:overall}. The algorithm takes as input the poset $\hierarchy$ describing the extraction domain, a set $K$ of valid query size assignments, a set $L$ of valid exclude list size assignments and a budget $\tau_c$. The algorithm also assumes access to an oracle providing the values $r(q)$ and $\sigma(q,t)$ - $t$ denotes the round count -  which characterize the upper gain of a query configuration $q$ and an oracle providing the cost $c(q)$ of $q$. Finally, the algorithm has access to the method ${\sf ActiveQueryConf}$ (see \Cref{sec:badactions}) which determines the possible query configurations to be considered at each round.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\small\caption{Multi-round Extraction Algorithm}
\label{algo:overall}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE {\bf Input:} $\hierarchy$: the hierarchy describing the entity domain; $K$: set of valid query size assignments; $L$: set of valid exclude-list size assignments; $\tau_c$: budget; $r,\sigma$: value oracle access to upper-bounded gain for different query configurations; $c$: value oracle access to the query configuration costs;
\STATE {\bf Output:} $\uentities$: a set of extracted distinct entities;
\STATE $\uentities \leftarrow \{\}$
\STATE $t \leftarrow 1$ /* Initialize round counter */
\STATE ${\sf Rembudget} \leftarrow \beta_c$ /* Initialize remaining budget */
\STATE $\mathcal{Q} \leftarrow$ {\sf ActiveQueryConf($\hierarchy$, $\emptyset$, NULL $K$, $L$, $t$)} /* Initialize active query configurations */
\WHILE {${\sf Rembudget} > 0$ and $\mathcal{Q} \neq \{\}$}
	\STATE $q^* \leftarrow \arg\max_{q \in {\mathcal{Q}}} \frac{r(q)+\sigma(q,t)}{c(q)}$ s.t. ${\sf Rembudget} - c(q^*) >0$
	\IF {$q^*$ is NULL }
		\STATE break;
	\ENDIF
	\STATE ${\sf Rembudget} \leftarrow {\sf Rembudget} - c(q^*)$ /* Update budget */
	\STATE Given configuration $q^* = (k^*,l^*,v^*)$ generate an exclude list $E$ such that $|E| = l^*$; 
	\STATE Issue query $q^{v^{*}}(k^*,E)$
	\STATE $E \leftarrow$ entities extracted by query $q^{v^{*}}(k^*,E)$
	\STATE $\uentities \leftarrow \uentities \cup E$ /* Update unique entities */
	\STATE $\mathcal{Q} \leftarrow$ {\sf ActiveQueryConf($\hierarchy$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $v^*$, $K$, $L$, $t$)} /* Update active queries */
	\STATE $t \leftarrow t + 1$ /* Increase round counter */
\ENDWHILE
\RETURN $\uentities$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Our multi-round extraction algorithm proceeds as follows: First it initializes the set $\uentities$ of extracted entities, the round count $t$, the remaining budget ${\sf Rembudget}$ and the set of candidate queries $\mathcal{Q}$ (i.e., query configurations to be considered) at the first round (Ln.3-6). Then it proceeds in rounds and iteratively selects one query configuration to be used until the total budget is utilized or the set of candidate queries is empty (Ln. 7). At each round our algorithm performs the following steps. It first detects a configuration in $\mathcal{Q}$ that maximizes the score quantity $\frac{r(q) + \sigma(q,t)}{c(q)}$ under the constraint that the cost $c(q)$ is less or equal to the remaining budget (Ln. 8). If no such configuration exists the algorithm terminates (Ln. 9-10). Otherwise, the algorithm proceeds by executing a query corresponding to the selected configuration $q^*$, updates the set of extracted entities, the remaining budget, the set of active queries, and the round counter (Ln. 11 - 17). Finally, Algorithm 1 returns the set of distinct entities extracted (Ln. 18). 

\vspace{2pt}\noindent\textbf{Discussion.} The reason we chose $\frac{r(q) + \sigma(q,t)}{c(q)}$ as the assigned query configuration score is due to the presence of a budget and the connection between budgeted crowdsourced entity extraction and knapsack style problems. Finally, method ${\sf ActiveQueryConf}$ is used to restrict the set of candidate query configurations considered by our algorithm. As discussed before the size of $\hierarchy$ is exponential to the values of attributes describing it, and thus, considering all possible configurations $(k,l)$ for the different nodes of $\hierarchy$ can be prohibitively expensive. 

\subsection{Updating the Set of Actions}
\label{sec:badactions}
We now introduce an algorithm for effectively limiting the number of query configurations considered at each round of Algorithm \ref{algo:overall}. To do so we exploit the structure of poset $\hierarchy$ and the gain estimates for different query configurations $q = (k,l,v)$. Let $\mathcal{Q}$ denote the set of candidate (or active) query configurations to be considered. We propose an algorithm that {\bf adds} configurations to $\mathcal{Q}$ by traversing the input poset in a top-down manner. These configurations $(k,l,v)$ are associated with nodes $v$ that are {\em direct descendants} of already queried nodes. 

The reason we adopt a top-down traversal is two-fold: (i) Due to the hierarchical structure of the poset nodes at higher levels of the poset correspond to larger populations of entities. Therefore, issuing queries at these nodes can potentially result in a larger number of extracted entities. Hence, traversing the poset in a top-down manner allows us to detect sparsely populated areas of the poset and prune futile queries. (ii)According to our cost model assumption, issuing queries at higher-level nodes (i.e., less specialized queries) is cheaper. Therefore, the gain to cost ratio can be larger for queries that correspond to higher-level nodes of the poset.

As mentioned above the number of nodes in $\hierarchy$ can be prohibitively large, therefore we also {\bf remove} any {\em bad query configurations} from set $\mathcal{Q}$. A configuration $q$ is defined to be bad at round $t$ when $r(q) + \sigma(q,t) < \max_{q^{\prime} \in \mathcal{Q}} (r(q^{\prime}) - \sigma(q^{\prime},t))$. Intuitively, this states that we do not need to consider a configuration as long as there exists another one such that the upper-bounded gain of the former is lower than the lower bounded gain of the latter. This technique is also adopted in multi-armed bandits to limit the number of actions considered by the algorithm~\cite{EvenDar06actionelimination}. 

An overview of our algorithm is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algo:updateactions}. This also implements the method ${\sf ActiveQueryConf}$ introduced above. The algorithm takes as input the poset $\hierarchy$ describing the extraction domain, a set $K$ of valid query size assignments, a set $L$ of valid exclude list size assignments and a budget $\tau_c$. The algorithm also assumes access to an oracle providing the values $r(q)$ and $\sigma(q,t)$ - $t$ denotes the round count -  which characterize the upper gain of a query $q$ and an oracle providing the cost $c(q)$ of a query $q$. Finally, the algorithm has access to the method ${\sf ActiveQuerySet}$ (see \Cref{sec:badactions}) which determines the possible queries to be considered at each round.

An overview of our algorithm for determining the set of active queries to be considered at each round is shown in Algorithm~\ref{algo:updateactions}. This algorithm implements the method ${\sf ActiveQuerySet}$ introduced above. The method takes as input the poset $\hierarchy$ describing the extraction domain, a set $K$ of valid query size assignments, a set $L$ of valid exclude list size assignments, the running set $\mathcal{Q}_{old}$ of active query configurations, the node $v^*$ associated with the last query issued against the crowd, and the running round $t$. The algorithm also assumes access to an oracle providing the values $r(q)$ and $\sigma(q,t)$  which characterize the upper gain of a query configuration $q$.

The algorithm proceeds as follows: If the running set of active queries is empty (Ln. 3), i.e., if we have issued no queries previously, the set of active query configurations is initialized to contain all potential configurations $(k,l)$ associated with the root of the poset $\hierarchy$ (Ln. 6). Otherwise, the algorithm first adds all query configurations associated with the direct descendants of node $v^*$ to the running set $\mathcal{Q}_{old}$ (Ln. 9 - 11) and then removes any bad query configurations from the new set $\mathcal{Q}_{new}$ (Ln.13-16). The algorithm terminates by returning the set $\mathcal{Q}_{new}$.
